# Inventory Management Data Analytic project using SQL and Looker studio

# Project Overview
This Inventory Management Dashboard was created to provide a complete, data-driven view of stock performance, product turnover, restocking priorities, and financial trends in inventory handling. It is built using SQL for data preparation and Google Looker Studio for interactive visualization.

The dashboard supports real-time decision-making by offering insights into:

- Stock quantity vs reorder thresholds
- Inventory value and cost analysis
- Product-level movement and efficiency
- Estimated runout risks and restocking urgency
- Category and supplier-level performance

The goal is to help businesses reduce stockouts, prevent overstock, and ensure efficient inventory turnover.

# üèóÔ∏è Dataset Overview:
This dataset provides detailed information on various grocery items, including product details, stock levels, reorder data, pricing, and sales performance. The data covers 990 products across various categories such as Grains & Pulses, Beverages, Fruits & Vegetables, and more.
**The dataset has the following key columns:**
Product_ID, Product_Name, Category, Supplier_ID, Supplier_Name, Stock_Quantity, Reorder_Level, Reorder_Quantity, Unit_Price, Received_Date, Last_Order_Date, Sales_Volume, Inventory_Turnover_Rate, Status (Active, Discontinued, Backordered).

# üìÅ Tools Used
- SQL (Bigquery) - Data enrichment, transformation and metric derivation.
- Google Sheets - Dataset quick preview.
- Google Looker Studio - Interactive data visualization and dashboard building.
  
# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
I perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Grocery Inventory and Sales Dataset in BigQuery using SQL, I focused on understanding the dataset‚Äôs structure, distributions, patterns, and potential issues to inform your inventory management project.

EDA helped me uncover insights like stock trends, sales patterns, and data quality issues before building metrics like turnover or ABC analysis. 

# EDA Objectives for Inventory Management
- Understand the dataset‚Äôs structure (columns, data types, row count).
- Identify missing or inconsistent data.Analyze distributions (e.g., stock levels, sales).
- Detect patterns (e.g., seasonal sales, stockouts).
- Spot outliers or anomalies (e.g., unusually high/low stock).
- Prepare for deeper analysis (e.g., turnover).

  # SQL Queries for EDA.  
**1. Understand Table Structure**
*Purpose: Check column names, data types, and sample data - view table schema and sample rows*
```SELECT *

LIMIT 20;

*Count Total Rows*
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows
FROM data-analytics-project-438511.grocery_inventory.inventory_analysis;```

# üîπ Data Preparation (SQL)

A combined SQL query was written to enrich the raw dataset with additional computed columns for analysis:
```SELECT

  (Stock_quantity * Unit_price) AS Inventory_Value,

    WHEN Stock_Quantity > (Reorder_Level * 2) THEN 'Overstocked'
    ELSE 'Adequate Stock'
  END AS Stock_Status,

# üìå Key Metrics & Definitions

**This SQL query generated the backbone for advanced metrics like:**

- **Inventory Value**:	Total value of items in stock (Stock √ó Unit Price)
- **Reorder Urgency Ratio**:	Stock level as a % of reorder level (for backend logic)
- **Restock Priority**:	Categorizes urgency (High, Medium, Low)
- **Estimated Runout Days**:	How many days stock can last at current sales pace
- **Turnover Category**:	Based on turnover rate: Fast/Moderate/Slow
- **Reorder Gap**:	Shortfall between current stock and reorder level
- **Reorder Cost**:	Estimated cost to restock (Stock Qty √ó 2 for buffer)

**These calculated fields were then imported into Google Looker Studio via a connected data source.**

# ‚úÖ Insights
. 
- Fruits & Vegetables category shows high stock quantity significantly exceeding their reorder levels - suggesting overstocking which could increase storage costs or lead to spoilage.
- Beverages, Bakery and Fat and Oil categories are approaching critical thresholds, indicating a need to review replenishment plans.
- Grain and Pulses category has stock levels below reorder thresholds, putting them at high risk of stockouts and potential lost sales.
- Dairy and Seafood categoroes are well aligned- efficient inventory control

2. **Inventory health**
47% of all inventory are currently in low stock condition, indicating a widespread risk of stockouts if not addressed promptly. 28 % of inventory is overstocked, which may lead to excess holding costs and potentialwaste, especially for perishable goods.Only 27% of inventory is at an adequate stock level, suggesting improvement in inventory planning.

for dashboard
Nearly half of inventory is understocked (47%). Urgent restocking is needed, while 28% is overstocked - consider reduction or redistribution. Only 27% of products is on target

3. Fruits & Vegetables have the highest inventory value and longest runout period, indicating potential overstock, holding cost and spoilage as there are perishables
In contrast, Beverages and Bakery show shorter runout days, highlighting urgency for replenishment.

üî∫ Reorder Cost Volatility:

4. The line chart reveals that Inventory Value consistently exceeds Reorder Cost, indicating good cost control ‚Äî except in October, where Reorder Cost slightly exceeds Inventory Value, possibly due to urgent or bulk restocking.

In Febuary 2024 and 2025, both metrics show a gradual decline, possibly signaling: Slower sales or lower demand

5. Inventory Status:
About 47% of products are Active, while 33% are Backordered and 20% are Discontinued. This indicates strong operational health but with one-third of products facing availability or supply chain issues.

6. Turnover Category:
A majority (69.5%) of products are Fast-moving, which is a positive indicator of high product demand and efficient inventory turnover. However, 16.7% Moderate and 13.8% Slow-moving items may tie up capital or underperform in sales ‚Äî requiring further attention.

7. Avg Days in Stock vs Sales-to-Stock Ratio:
Dairy and Seafood have high sales efficiency (high sales-to-stock ratios) but relatively short average days in stock, creating a risk of frequent stockouts.
Bakery and Beverages have both low stock days and low sales-to-stock ratios, suggesting they may be low performers or over-ordered

# üìå Recommendation:
1. 
üî∫ Restock urgent categories: Prioritize restocking categories with low runout days (e.g., Bakery, Beverages), close to or below reorder threshold to avoid stockouts.
2. Reassess reorder points and review demand trends for overstocked categories.
3. Investigate the October cost anomaly and assess whether current declining trends in both inventory and reorder cost reflect planned optimization or signal understocking risks.
4. Review overstocked items like Fruits & Vegetables to reduce
5. ‚úÖ Double down on fast-movers: with 69.5% of products fast-moving, continue investing in demand planning and stock optimization to sustain efficiency.
 excess holding costs or apply targeted promotions.
6. üì¶ Reassess slow/moderate movers: Review pricing, promotions, or replacement options for slow-moving items to prevent capital lockup.
7. ‚ö†Ô∏è Stabilize backorders: With 33% of products backordered, consider investigating supplier lead times or introducing buffer stock for critical SKUs.

Monitor sales-to-stock ratios to identify fast-moving items worth prioritizing in inventory and forecast models.

Continuously monitor Sales-to-Stock Ratios to align stock levels with demand patterns.

# üìå Conclusion
This dashboard allows any business to visualize and act on inventory data, prevent losses due to overstocking or stockouts, and align restocking efforts with sales patterns. It‚Äôs designed with both business stakeholders and analysts in mind, balancing high-level clarity with operational detail.
